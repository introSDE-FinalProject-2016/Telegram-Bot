# Telegram-Bot

The User Interface layer allows the users to visualize, insert, modify data. We use the Telegram Bot platform. Bot are special Telegram accounts managed by software. The bot handles messages automatically. The user sends command messages in chats and the bot performs various action in order to respond.

This Bot is implemented using Ruby and with the help of the library [telegram-bot-ruby](https://github.com/atipugin/telegram-bot-ruby). The bot uses HTTPS request to communicate with Telegram and the API of [Business Logic Services](https://github.com/introSDE-FinalProject-2016/BusinessLogicServices) and [Process Centric Services](https://github.com/introSDE-FinalProject-2016/ProcessCentricServices) to interact with my system. To implement a REST client for Ruby we used [rest-client](https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client).
